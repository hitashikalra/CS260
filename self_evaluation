Self-Evaluation:

- The program passes all functional tests with correct outputs.
- Memory management is handled properly with no memory leaks detected.
- Runtime performance is good, but there’s room for improvement as Tests 6 and 7 exceed the expected runtime threshold.
- The code is well-structured, and I’ve followed proper coding practices.
- Overall, I’m satisfied with the program’s correctness and will work on optimizing performance further.
